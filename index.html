    <h1>AMAZON</h1>
    <p>The Amazon is a vast biome that spans eight rapidly developing countries—Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, and Suriname—and French Guiana, an overseas territory of France.</p>
    <i>There is a clear link between the health of the Amazon and the health of the planet. The rain forests, which contain an estimated 150-200 billion tons of carbon, help stabilize the local and global climate. Deforestation releases significant amounts of this carbon, which is having negative consequences around the world.</i>
